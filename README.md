### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning Web Developement and bulding a toy [fullstack project](https://github.com/Eyon42/DocAuth).

Beside that I do freelance work, mostly with data visualization (Matplotlib, Plotly and Bokeh), but I'm open to projects in Data Engineering, Data Science and Back-end Developement.
